This directory contains xml files (which in turn contain concatenated alignments), newick, 
and phylip formatted tree files, datasets, and code used for analyses and generating figures.

~/LEMURS/PHYLOGENETICS/ contains the maximum clade credibility tree from the lemur phylogenetic inference. See the paper and supplemental tables for more information.
~/LEMURS/PHYLOMORPHOSPACE/ contains scripts, datasets, and trees used in analyzing the lemur phylogenetic morphological space and inferring ancestral character states. See the paper and supplemental tables for more information.
~/LEMURS/REGRESSION/ contains scripts and datasets used in conducting a linear regression to calculate frugivorous lemur gape size. See the paper and supplemental tables for more information.
~/CANARUIUM/ contains the maximum clade credibility tree, datasets, and scripts used in calculating the Canarium phylogenetic morphospace and inferring ancestral character states. See the paper and supplemental tables for more information.
